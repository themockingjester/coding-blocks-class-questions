You are provided an integers N. You need to count all possible distinct binary strings of length N such that there are no consecutive 1â€™s.
Input Format

First line contains integer t which is number of test case. For each test case, it contains an integer n which is the the length of Binary String.
Constraints

1<=t<=100 1<=n<=90
Output Format

Print the number of all possible binary strings.
Sample Input

2
2
3

Sample Output

3
5

Explanation

1st test case : 00, 01, 10 2nd test case : 000, 001, 010, 100, 101
